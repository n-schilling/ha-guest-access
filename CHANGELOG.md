## [0.1.0] - unreleased

### Added

- Guest profiles with any number of `device_tracker` entities, an approval (once until, permanent until, permanent, optionally a time window), a grace time within which a return continues the visit (and after which a once approval ends), rooms and a time per visit.
- Counting rules: a guest counts while the approval holds and a tracker is home; an expiry while home keeps the guest counting and fires an event; a once approval ends after the grace time; a visit survives a restart when a tracker returns within ten minutes.
- Room lock: lockable rooms are areas with one door contact; while only guests are home, the doors of rooms no counting guest may enter raise a room violation.
- Entities: per guest a presence sensor, a status sensor (counts, time up, approval expired, home without approval, waiting after restart, away), a visit-end timestamp and an event entity; for all guests "Guests home", "Only guests home" and the room violation event entity.
- An administrator-only page in the sidebar to add, change, lock and delete guests and to set residents and rooms, over administrator-only WebSocket commands.
